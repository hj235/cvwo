### 2. Configure the Server

1. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with the following content:
   ```env
   SERVER_PORT=4000
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
   MYSQL_PORT=3306
   MYSQL_DATABASE=webforum
   ```

### 3. Start the Backend Server

Run the following command from the `server` folder:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 4. Configure the Client

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder:

   cd client/webforum
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the `client/webforum` folder with the following content:

## Application Usage

Once the above steps are complete:

- The **backend server** should be running at: `http://localhost:4000`
